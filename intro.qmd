# Overview

### What is Biodiverse? 

Biodiverse is an open source tool for the spatial analysis of diversity using indices based on taxonomic, phylogenetic, matrix and trait-based relationships. Analyses can be run on a wide range of variables that vary across space and/or time whether they are biological, physical or lingual.

For example, the [diversity distributions of marsupials across Australia], or [variation in rainfall across continental US], even geographic and temporal [distribution of various Mediterranean dialects], can all be analysed with Biodiverse. 

### What analyses can I do with Biodiverse?

You can run a range of spatial analyses, such as: 

- cluster
- moving window 
- randomisation analyses

You can also visualise analysis results in interactive diagrams and maps, and optionally export analysis results to a variety of formats (e.g. delimited text, geoTIFF, JSON) to third party software for further analysis, such as ESRI ArcGIS, R and Matlab.

[BiodiverseR](https://github.com/shawnlaffan/BiodiverseR) - an R package to Biodiverse is currently under development to offer the same functionality as the main software

### What is covered in this Quick Start Guide

This Quick Start guide introduces you to the main features of Biodiverse. It draws information from the full range of more extensive [Biodiverse help documentation ](https://github.com/shawnlaffan/biodiverse/wiki)

Specifically we will cover how to do the following in Biodiverse: 

- Importing and exporting data
- Data visualisation 
- Cluster analysis
- Spatial moving window analysis
- Randomism analysis

The tutorials in this guide use the sample data sets provided in the `Biodiverse/data` folder. 

This guide does not cover all the detailed aspects of Biodiverse functionality, so links to the online [Biodiverse documentation](https://github.com/shawnlaffan/biodiverse/wiki) covering more detailed information are provided throughout.

### Where can I get additional help?

You can access a range of Biodiverse Help Topics by clicking on the Help option on the menu bar within the Biodiverse application

You can also hover the mouse pointer over most buttons and menu items in Biodiverse to view their associated tooltips. 

Alternatively, you can post your question at our [Google Group Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/biodiverse-users). We recommend searching through past conversations to see if your question has been raised by others.


### Which operating systems does Biodiverse support?
 
Biodiverse is supported on Windows, MacOS and Linux platforms. 

You can install the binary/executable or source code versions of Biodiverse at out [Installation Page](https://github.com/shawnlaffan/biodiverse/wiki/Installation)

The binary/executable is 'all-in-one' which includes the analysis engine + GUI. 

If you just want the analysis engine only, follow the installation instructions for the source code version. 

### What programming language is Biodiverse developed in?

Biodiverse - the software itself comes in two parts: 

- an analysis engine, which is written in [Pprl](https://www.perl.org/) 
- a graphic user interface (GUI) which is developed using [Gtk2](https://www.gtk.org/)
