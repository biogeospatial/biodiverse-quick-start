    "text": "3.1 1.1 What is Biodiverse? {#1.1-what-is-biodiverse?}\nBiodiverse is a free tool for the spatial analysis of diversity using indices based on taxonomic, phylogenetic, matrix and trait-based relationships. Analyses can be run on a wide range of variables that vary across space and/or time, whether they are biological (e.g., diversity distributions of marsupials across Australia), physical (e.g., variation in rainfall across continental US), or other systems (e.g., geographic and temporal distribution of various Mediterranean dialects).",

You can also hover the mouse pointer over most buttons and menu items in Biodiverse to view their associated tooltips.\nThis guide does not cover all the detailed aspects of Biodiverse functionality, so links to the online Biodiverse documentation covering more detailed information are provided throughout. Alternatively, visit the Biodiverse Project Home for more extensive software documentation.\nYou can also send questions to the Biodiverse discussion forum at https://github.com/shawnlaffan/biodiverse/discussions or at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/biodiverse-users.

    "text": "3.8 1.8 Some key terminology\nThe two concepts below are important when using Biodiverse. For details of a fuller list of Biodiverse terminology, see the Data Structures page.\n\n3.8.1 1.8.1 Labels\nTypically labels represent species, but in reality they can be any named entity that is then aggregated, or ‘binned’, into a Group. Hence, an individual label could also represent other taxonomic levels, e.g. a genus, or distinct entities from other phenomena, such as lithological classes (e.g. different rock types) or linguistic structures (e.g. different phonemes).\n\n\n3.8.2 1.8.2 Groups\nGroups are cells into which the labels are aggregated (binned). These are usually square, but can represent any number of axes (x, y, z, time, population-ID, …) with differing cell sizes (resolutions) and numeric or text types. The groups are plotted in the interactive maps that Biodiverse produces as outputs of data visualisation and spatial analyses, as in the example below. Groups are also integral to the spatial components of the moving window, cluster and randomisation analyses.\nPlease note however, that group coordinates are in the same coordinate system (map projection) as the input data. If you have input data in multiple files, with differing coordinate systems, then you can use GIS or other geospatial tools such as the sf library in R to project them into a common system.\n![][image3]\nThe ‘Groups’ are the square cells representing the Australian mainland.",
